# Autumn

![Trees](./autumn.gif)

In this project, I capture the changing leaves of trees on Pier 84 in Manhattan.

# Steps

1. Upload new images to the `images` folder, following the `IMG_MMDD.jpeg` convention
2. Use `gui.ipynb` to label the 5 anchor points
3. Enter anchor points into `points.csv`
4. Run `align-perspective.ipynb` to perform alignment and create gif
